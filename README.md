# Lisp Interpreter 
During the course Programming Languages, we have implemented an interpreter for Lisp in Standard ML. This repo is a compilation of all of our homework assignments into one working interpeter.
# Running the Interpreter
In order to use the interpreter, first you must install [Standard ML of New Jersey](http://www.smlnj.org/dist/working/110.71/index.html). Once you have that, simply clone the repo, open your favorite command line interpreter, and enter "sml interpreter.sml". You can then type Lisp S-Expressions, which our interpreter will read, evaluate, and print.
